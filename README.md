# Project-Third-Person

"Project Third Person" was a 4 week project where we had to create a Engine and Game using only c++ and OpenGL.
The project was worked on by 8 people (3 Engineers,3 Artists and 2 Designers).
The project developement is split into 2 main Parts: Engine and Game.


## Game: BASIN

 Basin is a local PVP game where you have to paint as much tiles as possible is a set amount of time. The player with most
 tiles covered wins the game. You can also kill the opponent by painting the tile he is currently on and then he will
 explode, painting a square around him. There are 2 main levels to the game. First level introduces the basic mechanics of
 the game like painting and moving and the second one introduces more tricky mechanics such as cannons and bombs.
 
 ## Engine: MGE (METRO GAME ENGINE)
 
 MGE is a 3D c++/OpenGl custom made component based game engine. MGE provides the choice to place objects manually in code
 or use Unity3D as a level editor, the repository for the level editor can be found [here](https://github.com/igli15/UnityAsEngineEditor).
 MGE provides support for lua scripting. There is a wrapper already build in and the engine uses a "resources.lua" file to load
 assets. Again a choice is provided weather you want to use lua or load them manually through c++.
 MGE rendering pipleline provide Bling-phong lighting and supports all lights types (Directional/point/spot). Rendering supports
 Diffuse/Specular/Emission/Normal maps.
